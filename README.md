### Hello there 👋, 

### I’m Brandon and I'm a full stack engineer.

For the past 7 years at NTT Data Inc I've been building and delivering innovative web based solutions for their clients.

I work mainly with .NET, PowerShell, MS Test\Moq, Azure, Azure DevOps, SharePoint and JavaScript. I know my way around Angular, .NET Core, Python, Django, FastAPI,  Selium, MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch\Kibana, Docker, Git, Flutter, and Linode.

For my personal life, 
 - I'm believer of Jesus Christ who is my savior 
 - Husband and a father of 3
 - A fan of sci-fi, mystery novels and biographies (favorite authors include Walter Mosley, Black Crouch, and Michael Crichton) 
 - Sports fan of Phillies, Eagles, Sixers, Flyers, Aves, West Virgina Mountaineers (Basketball and Baseball Only), University of South Carolina (Football and Baseball Only) and Everton FC

🌱 Currently I'm learning Azure, Linode, Azure DevOps, Python, AI\Machine Learning.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Azure, Python and Bioinformatics projects.
